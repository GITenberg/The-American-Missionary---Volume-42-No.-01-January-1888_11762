    <h3>A HAPPY NEW YEAR!</h3>
    <p>A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! It is an inspiring delight to hear and
    speak the greeting. It is a phrase that comes down to us from the ages. All the more
    gladly do we repeat it on that account. There are some things, thank God, even in
    this world, that never grow old. The greetings of Christmas and New Year are among
    them. This is because they are connected with Christ and his kingdom. True happiness
    for mankind first came into this world when Christ was born. In proportion as he is
    received into human life, happiness is experienced. Therefore, in wishing for our
    readers a happy New Year, we are wishing for them more of Christ in their thought and
    life.</p>
    <p>But Christ never comes into a life to be held there in confinement. He seeks our
    life that it may become a channel through which he may flow to bless and make happy
    other lives. He is not only our peace&mdash;he is our righteousness as well. How
    miserable we would be in our sins and shortcomings were this not so! But all the more
    on that account will we desire to <i>do</i> what we can to make up for our
    deficiencies. Loving him, we shall want to do his will. He wills that all shall hear
    of the salvation his gospel brings. We can proclaim the message. He wills that all
    shall see the power of his gospel in the benevolent fruits of his followers' lives.
    We can exhibit that power. Where we cannot go to tell the story and exhibit the power
    in person, we can send. Therefore, in wishing for our readers a happy New Year, we
    are wishing for them a righteousness that will manifest Christ actually saving the
    world in what they say and do. Happiness through service and sacrifice&mdash;this is
    the happiness THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY wishes for all its readers, because it is the
    only happiness worth having.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>While January is the first month of the calendar year, it happens to be the fourth
    month of the A.M.A.'s fiscal year. It is a good time for our friends to make new
    resolutions in reference to what they will do in <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page2" id="page2"></a>{2}</span> support of our work the coming year. We closed
    last year out of debt. It was a cause for joy and thanksgiving. The Portland meeting
    felt and expressed it. Letters of congratulation came to us from all parts of the
    country. But there is something about prosperity that almost inevitably fosters
    decline. A woe seems to be attached to institutions as well as individuals of which
    all men speak well. We need $25,000 a month to pay necessary bills. We ought to have
    $30,000 a month to properly prosecute the work at this moment on hand. Our total
    receipts at the end of the first two months of the new fiscal year were $33,336. The
    lowest figure, in order to enable us to meet our bills for the two months, is
    $50,000. The result is, we are again obliged to report payments in excess of
    receipts. We do it unwillingly. We want very much to be delivered from the necessity
    of making special appeals along toward the end of the year. This necessity can be
    avoided only through our friends' securing increased receipts to our treasury the
    early part of the year. Now is the time to resolve that it shall be done. Let every
    church vote to give us a contribution. Let every individual friend resolve that he
    will, if possible, increase his contribution over that of last year, and that in any
    event he will by personal effort enlarge the circle of our supporters by inducing
    some friend or friends to take an interest in our work.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Memorial services in honor of our late President, Hon. Wm. B. Washburn, were held
    at Greenfield, Mass., Gov. Washburn's home, November 29th, under the auspices of the
    Connecticut Valley Congregational Club. Addresses were made by U.S. Senator Hoar,
    Rev. Dr. Buckingham, and President Seelye.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Thirty dollars constitute a Life Membership. Some of our friends utilize their
    contributions in this way. One of these writes us: "This is my thirty-first Life
    Member which it is my good fortune to make to your society." A good example to
    follow.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Lord Shaftsbury once said: "I think it would be of the greatest value if the
    reports of the various Religious and Charitable Societies were at once, by Act of
    Parliament, elevated into the dignity of Blue Books. If every Member of Parliament,
    under the most severe penalty&mdash;and more particularly the ministers of the
    day&mdash;were compelled to study them accurately, and then undergo a competitive
    examination, I am satisfied that great good would accrue to themselves and benefit to
    their country; their enlarged notions, and probably improved hearts, would be felt in
    the legislation of the country."</p>
    <a name="editorial2" id="editorial2"></a>
    <p>A pertinent illustration of the force of this statement is the speech of <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>{3}</span> Senator Frye, made at the
    Portland meeting. The Senator confessed that he had not been familiar with the
    history of the American Missionary Association, that he had been reading its Annual
    Reports, and making himself acquainted with its work. Thereupon, out of what he had
    learned, he constructed a speech that was, in every way, worthy of the Statesman that
    he is. We shall be much mistaken if Senator Frye does not find occasion to use the
    knowledge obtained in the study of our Association's history in some of his speeches
    or debates in the U.S. Senate.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The citizens of Macon, Ga., gave Jefferson Davis a rousing reception on the
    occasion of his recent visit to that city. As a souvenir of his welcome, they
    presented him with 126 bottles of wine, thirty-three bottles of whiskey, fourteen
    bottles of brandy, and eleven boxes of cigars. If these gifts suggest anything in
    regard to the habits of Jefferson Davis, we can readily see that he was not a fit
    candidate for having the ladies put upon his lapel a blue ribbon. No wonder he rushed
    into print to assure the public that he was not in favor of total abstinence. A
    campaign in behalf of prohibition would have a hard time in the region of Macon.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Evan P. Howell and Henry W. Grady are among the owners of the <i>Atlanta
    Constitution</i>. During the recent campaign on the liquor question in Atlanta these
    gentlemen were on opposite sides, so that the papers reported that while Mr. Grady
    was making a speech in behalf of prohibition in one part of the town, Capt. Howell
    was making a speech against it in another place. Two of Mr. Grady's speeches have
    been published in pamphlet form, and they are worthy of that gentleman's reputation
    as an orator. THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY is glad to find Mr. Grady on the right side of
    this question, and regrets that prohibition failed to carry the day in the
    election.</p>
    <a name="editorial3" id="editorial3"></a>
    <p>The colored people held the balance of power. We praised them last year when,
    using that balance, they carried the city for temperance. We regret that this year
    they have used it against temperance. There is no use of concealing the fact.
    Ignorant people cannot be depended upon to take the right side of any question. It
    will be a mere happening if they do. The election in Atlanta gives additional
    emphasis to the necessity of our work in the South.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>White ladies so far overcame their caste prejudices as to join their colored
    sisters in the campaign for prohibition. Together they prayed and worked. Many of the
    white people were disgusted at this exhibition of social equality. These white ladies
    have taken a step in the right direction, and, when all their white sisters join
    them, reform will be well advanced. May the day be hastened!</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The rum advocates resorted to all manner of devices to influence the colored
    people. They had a circular printed with a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. The picture
    represented him standing, with a slave in chains kneeling before him. Under the
    picture, in quotation marks, were the words, as if spoken by Mr. Lincoln:
    "Prohibition is slavery; I will cut the manacles from your hands." This was a mean
    trick. To put such lying words into the mouth of a man whose name the colored people
    revere next to that of the Saviour, is a piece of wickedness that only rum-sellers
    could be guilty of. It accomplished their vile purpose, however, in leading a great
    many colored people to vote against prohibition.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>A colored preacher who made anti-prohibition speeches, referring to a statement
    that their meetings were not opened with prayer, said that he would make as good a
    prayer as anybody. Thereupon he slowly prayed: "Oh! Lord, I pray thee to help Atlanta
    in her extremity. Oh, do lift her up and restore her to the proud place she once
    occupied before these prohibition fanatics got her by the throat. Oh, Lord Jesus, do
    thou make these deluded preachers see the error of their ways. Do help the sweet
    inhabitants of this city. [Cries of 'Amen!'] Do restore to them pure liquor, and not
    compel them to drink the vile stuff sold as 'nerve tonic,' 'rice beer' and 'bitters.'
    [Applause and laughter.] Give us power to win the fight. [Cries of 'Amen.'] Put to
    rout the miserable hypocrites who parade as thy servants under the guise of
    Prohibitionists. Oh, do save us and let us win this fight, for Jesus' sake, amen.
    [Cheers, and cries of 'Amen.']" What can be expected of a church with such a man for
    its pastor, and what can be expected of a people if left to such leadership?</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Rev. Geo. C. Rowe, of Charleston, S.C., in company with brethren Snelson, Maxwell,
    Jordan and Herron, going to attend the Association at Macon, Ga., by reason of a
    delayed train were in danger of missing connection at Jessup, a junction. The
    authorities telegraphed for the train to wait. When the little party reached Jessup,
    they found the train in waiting, and boarding it entered a first-class coach. We let
    Mr. Bowe tell the rest of the story:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"A burly white train-hand came in, and said, in a threatening way: 'The forward
      car is your car.' We gave him no answer, but kept our seats. The conductor came
      through and looked at us, but said nothing. At the door he asked, roughly, of a
      colored train hand, 'Why did you let those men go into that car?' They hardly knew
      how to act, as we were the only passengers who came on the S.F. &amp; W. train,
      and they had been ordered to wait for passengers on that train; so, doubtless
      considering <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>{5}</span>
      discretion the better part of valor, they left us severely alone, and we rode from
      Savannah to Macon, an eight-hour journey in <i>Georgia</i>, first class, without
      molestation. Of course, the white people who entered at various stations stared at
      us, but we were good at that and returned the compliment. First class, indeed! Men
      with turpentine clothes, or rags, on; women chewing snuff, etc., etc. If I looked,
      acted and talked like some of the people that I saw on that train, I should
      certainly feel myself an appropriate subject for an ox-cart in the backwoods,
      rather than for a first class coach on a railroad; yet these are the people who
      object to respectable, well-dressed, intelligent and Christian men and women riding
      in a decent coach, on account of their color."</p>

    be used for boarding pupils is in process of erection, and is greatly needed. Maine
    has joined hands with Tennessee in this most important work, several of the churches
    having given to this field.</p>
    <p>A new church has just been organized at Crossville, Tenn. Many northern families
    have come into this region within the past few months, and they will greatly assist
    us in gathering the native mountain people.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Grand View Academy, occupying a most commanding site on the top of a mountain
    overlooking the magnificent valley of the Cumberland River, has also increased its
    school accommodations. There will be here, in the not very distant future, a large
    college, reaching in its influence the mountain people back on the plateau and in the
    coves, and those who are rapidly filling the fertile valley along the foot of
    Cumberland Mountain and Walden's Ridge. If we, as Congregational Churches, hold this
    grand work, we must generously support it <i>now</i>.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>A specimen, a hybrid of civilization and paganism, I saw on the streets of Fort
    Smith, Arkansas. He seemed to illustrate the result of our governmental efforts to
    citizenize the Indian without Christianizing him. A tall Indian, of fine, commanding
    figure, walked down the street dressed in the following fashion: His feet were cased
    in moccasins, his legs in buckskin <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
    id="page6"></a>{6}</span> breeches. Both of these garments were highly ornamented
    with quills and beads. He was purely Indian so far. His tall lithe body was closely
    buttoned in a faded black Prince Albert coat. On his head he wore a Derby hat. So
    much for civilization. The hat had a hole in the crown, and in this hole the Brave
    had stuck a large tuft of eagle feathers that stood several inches above his head and
    nodded and danced above him as he walked with the royal dignity of a Mogg Megone.
    Here was civilization and savagery in dress at least. This is about what our
    Government is doing for this people; urging them to put on the faded coat of
    imperfect citizenship, and at the same time forbidding that they be instructed in the
    truths of religion in their own language. We can never civilize the body while we
    leave the heart savage. A visit to Fort Smith would convince anyone of the absolute
    failure of this method. In the miserable prison pen, one hundred and forty-four were
    crowded like cattle. Among this multitude of criminals were young boys, just entering
    upon a life of crime, imprisoned for some paltry offence, and herded with them were
    grey-headed murderers. All these prisoners were from the Indian Territory, or the
    "Nation" as they call it. One man had just been convicted of murder. Two beautiful
    daughters of an Indian mother stood weeping beside him. A gallows stands constantly
    on the edge of the "Nation," and is used with appalling frequency. A lawyer who
    courteously introduced me into the esoteric mysteries of the law as executed in this
    United States Court, pointed out the peculiar construction of the gallows which
    increased its capacity. "Eight men can stand on that plank and the drop will swing
    them all off at once," he said with evident pride, then added apologetically, "I
    never saw but six hung at one time, but they do hang eight."</p>
    <p>"Hanging day," I was informed, was one of the great festival occasions. Thousands
    of Indians, of more or less purity of blood, gathered from the "Nation" to enjoy this
    treat. There is an excuse for a fence around this perpetual gallows, but there are
    wide openings in it and the awful scene enacted within its enclosure can be witnessed
    from surrounding elevations.</p>
    <p>No doubt an attempt at justice is made in the United States Court. I attended the
    trial of a case and it seemed to me the accused had a fair hearing, but what a
    comment on our Christian civilization: A court overrun with cases; a prison pen with
    young boys and grey-headed criminals herded together in it; a gallows standing ready
    the year round; saloons and brothels permitted at every turn; bad men and worse women
    appealing to the lowest passions of ignorant and degraded men&mdash;all these the
    legalized representatives of a Christian civilization. Is it strange that these
    Indians do not accept more readily our Christian theories, when they come into
    constant contact with our most unchristian practice? The Indian language is used in
    saloons and gambling hells and brothels to lead these poor, heathen people to
    physical and moral perdition, but is forbidden by Government to be used in mission
    schools to lead them to the Lord Jesus <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
    id="page7"></a>{7}</span> Christ! We ought to plant a mission for the Indians and the
    colored people at Fort Smith this year. The work is painfully urgent.</p>

    <h4>RELIGIOUS INTEREST AT LINCOLN MEMORIAL CHURCH, WASHINGTON, D.C.</h4>
    <p>Rev. James Wharton, the English Evangelist, recently spent a little more than two
    weeks with the Lincoln Memorial Church, Washington. The people were deeply stirred,
    and the church was greatly quickened. About forty persons professed conversion, and a
    large number are still inquiring the way.</p>
    <p>The conversions were mostly among the young people. There were eight or ten adults
    who decided to live Christian lives, two of them being aged men, one 61 years and the
    other 75 years of age. They are both very happy in their new-found hope in
    Christ.</p>
    <p>Many of the young people would gladly unite with us, but their parents will not
    consent for them to do so, as they will not be convinced that the children can be
    Christians unless they can give a <i>remarkable experience</i>, and some will not be
    satisfied of their conversion unless the child has seen a vision or heard a
    voice.</p>
    <p>I called to-day to see the mother of a little girl who confessed Christ as her
    Saviour in our meetings. She said that her little girls, one eight years and the
    other twelve years of age, say that they are Christians. When the mother told Josie,
    the youngest child, that she did not have "<i>religion</i>," the little girl replied:
    "I love the Saviour, and Jesus loves me. He died for my sins, and I have accepted him
    as my Saviour and am happy in His love. Mamma, Mr. Moore says that that is religion.
    If that ain't religion, then, mamma, what is religion? I want to be an earnest
    Christian; will you show me how?" The mother says that Josie sticks to it that she is
    a Christian, and that she does not know what to do about it.</p>
    <p>The most of these young people, some of whom are twelve and fourteen years of age,
    will not be allowed to join any church, but will be laughed at and persecuted and led
    to expect some remarkable experience like "Saul of Tarsus," or to see a vision and
    hear a voice. We shall do what we can to encourage them to cling to Christ.</p>
    <p>We have succeeded in closing two saloons near our church, and are hopeful of
    closing another notorious den about a square away.</p>
    <p>There is no place where earnest Christian work is more needed than here at the
    nation's Capital, where we have a colored population of nearly 80,000, the majority
    of whom are out of Christ, and thousands are still shrouded in the darkness of
    ignorance and superstition.</p>

    <h3>THE INDIANS.</h3>
    <h4>THE FOURTH BROTHER.</h4>
    <p class="author">BY FRANK WOOD, ESQ.</p>
    <p>I believe that if the Master were visibly present with us to-day, and we should
    ask, "Where shall we go first with the Gospel?" he would say, "Go to that fourth
    brother, the North American Indian;" and for the strongest reasons.</p>
    <p>First, because he is in the greatest need. There are no people in want whose cry
    does not at once reach the heart of the American people. When Chicago was burned,
    when there was an earthquake in Charleston, when there was a famine in Ireland,
    public sympathy was immediately awakened, and all that was needed was sent. The only
    people who seem to be in need and do not receive help are the aborigines of our
    soil&mdash;the people whom we have dispossessed; whom we have crowded from their
    homes; whom we have shut into reservations until they are nothing but prisoners of
    war; whom we have placed under the control of a despot called an Indian agent, who is
    not controlled by law, who on that agency governs by his own will, with no courts to
    protect those who are wronged. These Indians are shut in on these reservations, kept
    from all civilizing and Christianizing influences, kept from trade and commerce. A
    trader is appointed over them, from whom they must buy everything they need, paying
    whatever he may ask, to whom they must sell everything that they would sell, taking
    what he may choose to give.</p>
    <p>We have, it is true, a cumbrous system of machinery which is supposed to educate
    and civilize the Indian, called the Indian Bureau. Some men have studied it for
    years, and they fail yet to comprehend it. I believe it is incomprehensible. I
    believe it was never intended to be understood. Some men ask what it does. It does
    little, and largely shows how <i>not</i> to do; and any effort to Christianize and
    elevate the Indians, so long as the present system remains, will be a failure. Now,
    when our philanthropists are endeavoring to lift them up, when our legislators are
    taking favorable action, this Indian Bureau, through its Assistant Commissioner,
    issues an order which says that the English language must be the only language taught
    or <i>spoken</i> in the mission-schools. The only language the Indian knows is
    forbidden. Suppose we were to try to learn a foreign language in that way? Suppose a
    Frenchman should come to teach us French, and neither of us spoke a word of
    English&mdash;how rapid would our progress be?</p>
    <p>Thirty barrels of whiskey and one thousand scalping knives were issued not many
    years ago as civilizing agencies by this department. An instance given us last night
    by our friend from across the water, shows that the English circumlocution office is
    a greyhound compared with our Indian office. I remember a similar story that Bright
    Eyes told in Boston some years ago.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>{9}</span>
    <p>She was then a teacher in an Indian school. She had little children in her school
    that came some seven, eight, or ten miles barefooted, and winter was coming on, and
    her heart sympathized with these poor children who came so far to be taught. They
    happened to have a good agent, and he said, "Send an order for shoes for these
    children;" and she sent an order, with a request that they send the shoes, as they
    were really needed, on account of the frost and snow. The order went to Washington,
    went through the regular routine, and the next spring, after winter had passed, a
    case of shoes came for these little Indian children. When it was opened, she found it
    full of brogans, that had been made for the Southern negro in the rice-fields; and
    every shoe in that case was so large that there was not an adult Indian on the
    reservation that could wear it. That is how the Indian Bureau provides for the little
    Indian children when there is a case of special necessity. (Laughter.)</p>
    <p>I could mention numerous illustrations showing that it is impossible to do any
    work that is required immediately, through this Indian Bureau. If people are
    starving, you cannot get food for them until they die.</p>
    <p>Now, what is the remedy? I believe that Christianity is the only remedy&mdash;the
    only solution of the Indian question. Where they have had good Christian
    agents&mdash;and they have had some&mdash;where they have missionaries, the Indian
    has made wonderful progress. I think we can point to a few civilized and
    Christianized communities among the Indians that can find no parallel among the
    whites of the country. There is less crime, less immorality, more faithfulness to the
    requirements of the Christian religion and better observance of the Sabbath, more
    sincerity and earnestness in the performance of every Christian duty, than we can
    find in the same number of whites anywhere. At Metlakatla, as told by Mr. Duncan, the
    Indians now form a community of twelve hundred people, who have their churches, their
    stores, their town-halls. They live in houses, like other people; they appear like
    civilized people; they carry on all the vocations of civilized life; and all this has
    been done by the work of one man. There is no liquor-drinking or liquor-selling
    there. A majority of this twelve hundred people are earnest, faithful, consistent
    Christians. They get no help from the Government. They have built up and support
    their churches. Where can you see anything among the whites that equals it?</p>
    <p>Then there is another reason why we should go to them with the gospel of Christ.
    It is a good thing to engage in works of charity and benevolence, but before we do
    this we should pay our debts. We owe so much to the Indians of this country, that I
    think before we go anywhere else we should do something to atone for the years of
    wrong, for the centuries of injury, that they have suffered at our hands. We have
    taken their homes from them. We have driven them from reservation to reservation. We
    have taken their crops when almost ready to reap. We have removed them into climates
    where they have died by hundreds. We <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
    id="page10"></a>{10}</span> have not listened to their cries. We have on various
    trumped-up charges frequently slaughtered these people, and treated them in the most
    cruel manner. There is no question that I know of that so holds a man, once
    interested, and so grows upon him, as this Indian question.</p>
    <p>I was first interested in this subject about ten years ago in the city of Boston,
    where Bright Eyes, Mr. Tibbles, and old Standing Bear came to tell of the wrongs of
    the Poncas. They were to hold a public meeting. Wendell Phillips was to speak. I went
    to that meeting more with a desire to hear Phillips than from any interest in the
    Indian. At that time all I knew about him was what I had learned from the current
    literature and romance, and my idea was very far from correct. At that meeting a
    state of affairs was shown to exist that seemed astounding and impossible. A
    committee was appointed to investigate these statements. They found that the half had
    not been told. That committee started measures that rectified these wrongs done to
    the Poncas. It commenced suit under the Fourteenth Amendment to see whether the
    Indians were citizens. The Judges of the Supreme Court decided that the Indian was
    not a person under the law. Then it tried other channels; to get legislation that
    would help the Indian. Senator Dawes soon became interested in this question, and
    from that time to the present he has been interested; and how much the Indian owes to
    the legislation which has been started and carried forward by Senator Dawes, but very
    few people know; but it must be followed by other legislation before the Indian is
    safe.</p>
    <p>In Boston, Mrs. H.H. Jackson listened to the statement of Bright Eyes in regard
    to the wrongs suffered by her people. She came to her and said, "It is not possible
    that these things can be true." Bright Eyes showed her the official documents; she
    convinced her that it was true. From that hour that woman's whole soul was in the
    work. She afterwards wrote "A Century of Dishonor," and "Ramona," which has preached
    for the Indians, and will continue to do so. She gave her life finally for the
    Indians, the sickness that caused her death being brought on while engaged in work
    for them. This work gets hold of a man, if he has any blood in his veins and sympathy
    in his heart, and makes him feel, if he would stand without condemnation before God
    in the last day, that he must do something to redeem his country from dishonor, and
    deliver this people from worse than slavery.</p>
    <p>Suppose we do not do it. Suppose we allow the Government to care for them. The
    Dawes Bill gives them citizenship, but what does the Indian get? One hundred and
    sixty acres of land&mdash;and he as naked as a babe on that land. He has had no
    training in education and systematic work of any kind; he has no tools&mdash;and if
    he had he would not know how to use them. He is in the midst of white enemies, who
    want his land. He has turned his back upon all the traditions of his ancestors. He
    has turned his face toward the whites, and his friends of the past are now his
    enemies. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>{11}</span> He is in
    the midst of his reservation. His homestead is his own, yet no American citizen has a
    right there. If you and I go to teach him, we can be ordered off by the agent; and if
    we do not go he can put us in prison.</p>
    <p>If we do not give protection and Christianity to them, there is no hope for these
    Indians. Their fate will be the same as Indians on the reservation in the State of
    New York, who have been for one hundred years in the midst of our best civilization,
    but are still lazy and shiftless, their reservation being permeated through and
    through with unmentionable vices. They have no interest in the civilization of the
    present. They are living in the past, dreaming over the glory of their ancestors.
    They cannot be reached through civilization without religion. To an Indian there is
    nothing secular. Everything pertains to his religion. When he goes on a hunt, if he
    has no success, it is because the gods are opposed to him; and if he is successful,
    the gods were in it. When we go to an Indian and seek to change him, we must first
    change his gods. We must Christianize him if we would civilize him. There is where
    many of our experiments have been wrong.</p>
    <p>Is it not laid upon us, who know something of this work, to do this? I believe if
    we will not do it, that in the last great day, as we stand with the Indian before the
    judgment bar of God, our position will be worse than that of the Indian. It seems to
    me that I can hear what the Judge would say to him at that time. The Indian comes
    before God, a pagan from a Christian land; he comes having improved none of the
    powers that God gave him. The Lord might say to him: "Did I not give you as good
    opportunities and as good capacities as the white man in whose midst you were? This
    Christian nation is the foremost for missions. It has sent to all the lands of the
    earth, and yet here you come a pagan, not knowing God, uncivilized, a barbarian."
    Might not this Indian say: "I was in prison. I was surrounded by a reservation around
    whose outside lines were the soldiers of the United States, and I would be shot if I
    went off this reservation. I had no business with which to support myself; I had no
    chance for trade or commerce; I had to buy of and sell to one man. What opportunity
    had I? When an occasional missionary came to me with the gospel of Christ, I looked
    upon this man as one of my enemies&mdash;a man from the nation that had robbed me of
    my opportunities; and, my Father, why should I listen to him, especially when he
    spoke in a strange language? Am I to blame that I come here empty? Am I to blame that
    I must go away?" I believe the Lord would turn to us and say, "Inasmuch as ye have
    not done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have not done it unto Me."
    And, speaking for myself alone, I would rather at that last day be in the place of
    that darkened Indian&mdash;-savage, barbarian, pagan, as he is&mdash;than in the
    place of the Christian that knew of his need and would not help him.</p>

    <h3>THE CHINESE.</h3>
    <h4>DOES RESTRICTION RESTRICT?</h4>
    <p>As a son of Maine, I am one of those who believe that prohibition <i>can</i>
    prohibit, and will do so effectively, if you will give it a fair chance, but I doubt
    whether restriction restricts, and have expressed that doubt in these columns more
    than once already. But we have been favored with fresh lessons on this subject, in
    its application to Chinese immigration. Chinese women are held in our San Francisco
    market, at prices ranging from nothing up to about $2,000. The soul, being that of a
    woman, has no value at any time, but the body, till worn out, is held at a fair
    percentage of its weight in gold.</p>
    <p>Such being the demand, a supply became assured. No artificial barriers could
    exclude them. There would soon come to be some "Open Sesame" which no bolts could
    resist. As a matter of fact these women have been landed in numbers so great, and
    with an effrontery so flagrant, that even the Chinese Consulate now takes the matter
    up and puts to shame the appointed executors of American law. As to persons of the
    male sex, they come by various routes: some with certificates sent out to Hong Kong
    by our own officials to be sold there and vise&eacute;d by themselves on this side
    the sea; some come with strange stories of previous residence&mdash;stories confirmed
    by their vivid recollection of deep <i>snow</i> on Clay Street, and of <i>Chinese</i>
    conductors on our street-cars: some come smuggled from British Columbia, across Puget
    Sound, and others cross the invisible line between Canadian soil and that of our own
    <i>free</i> land with none to say them nay. Meanwhile some of our recent officials
    who have grown rich with strange rapidity, or have spent money with lavish
    generosity, are under arrest, and sensational developments are the daily promise of
    "live newspapers" in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>What shall be done? Some of these papers (however incredulous they may be about
    prohibition prohibiting) are disposed to try it upon Chinese immigration. Nothing
    else, they tell us, can deliver us from a perpetual invasion by these Asiatic hordes.
    But, so far as I have seen, no ringing or enthusiastic response has greeted this
    suggestion. So long as it lives only in newspaper paragraphs, and no serious danger
    appears of its being put into effect, few men will have courage, or zeal and
    forwardness enough to contend with it, but let it be taken up in earnest, and pressed
    to actual enactment, and it would soon go the fit and ignoble way that the
    <i>boycott</i> has travelled. There are multitudes who do not object to cursing the
    Chinaman, but who don't mean to lose the double eagles which Chinese labor, and that
    alone, enables them to put to credit on their bank account.</p>
    <p>It seems to me, however, well worth questioning whether a law that after six years
    of trial has been found to be fruitful in little except perjuries <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>{13}</span> and briberies,&mdash;a
    law which cannot be shown to have benefited a single American laborer, but has had
    some effect to compel house-holders to pay larger wages to Chinese domestics, and to
    enable Chinese fruit-pickers to make better terms with our fruit-growers:&mdash;it
    seems to me a question whether a statute of that sort might not be suffered to expire
    through its own limitations, without any damage to the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p>Whatever the fate of this law may be, it is sufficiently evident that our gospel
    work need not be stayed for lack of souls to work upon, till China herself and all
    her broad domain, becomes the Lord's.</p>
    <h5>YONG JIN AT SACRAMENTO.</h5>
    <p>I reserve a little space in order to give our readers a little sample of this
    gospel work as it appears in a letter from our helper, Yong Jin. He has recently
    returned from China where he did good service under Rev. Mr. Hazen, and he has
    resumed service with us. "I will tell you what I had to do with the brethren. Monday
    night after the school is out [i.e. 9:30] we have the Bible lesson of Chinese, and
    Tuesday night too. Wednesday night we have a prayer-meeting after school is out.
    Thursday night we have ten or fifteen minutes to speak the gospel before the school
    is out. Friday night we have a Bible lesson in Chinese too. Saturday night we have a
    prayer meeting again. Sunday night all the same. But last Sunday noon I preach on the
    street where the Chinese live. Perhaps I will preach in the street nest Sunday. By
    and by, if I do not preach on the street, I shall preach in the mission-house on
    Sunday noon. I shall do as best I can, and I hope God will help us to do."</p>
    <p>I will add that we are hoping to commence special evangelistic work early in
    December. Loo Quong will go to our missions in Southern California, and Chin Toy to
    those north of us, beginning in Stockton, where the door seems to be opening wide,
    and an earnest spirit among the brethren gives promise of good results. I wish these
    brethren might be remembered by our Eastern brethren with special prayer.</p>

    <p>The estimation in which "woman's work for woman" is held by our more thoughtful
    colored students, will be shown by some extracts from an address by a graduate of
    Tougaloo University in Mississippi.</p>
    <p>The effect of very unhappy experiences in early youth upon an exceedingly
    sensitive temperament, was to make this son of a white father and black mother
    cherish a feeling of intense hatred toward all white people as he was growing up; but
    being led, in the good providence of God, to a Christian training-school where he
    heard of One who suffered every indignity, and when dying in torture and ignominy
    prayed, "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do," new thoughts and
    feelings came to him.</p>
    <p>He thought there might be cruel men in the world now who know not what they do. He
    was led to bow in penitence and submission at the feet of Jesus. It is now his chief
    joy that since he entered upon the path of learning, he has, as a teacher, given
    several thousand children a start in the same path.</p>
    <p>The little old chapel at Tougaloo having burned down in January, 1882, he
    graduated in the spring of that year, from our elementary normal course, in the new
    barn, Ayrshire Hall. He has since passed through our higher normal and college
    preparatory course, and is pursuing further studies in another institution, in the
    intervals teaching, and going from place to place with the great desire in his heart
    of bringing about a better condition of feeling and living, among the people of the
    State.</p>
    <p>I quote from his printed speech: "We read of a time when 'a nation shall be born
    in a day.' We have seen it come to pass, and this people is a babe yet. 'Is not the
    babe a blessing in the house? Its very helplessness is a blessing, in that it
    educates the finest sensibilities of humanity.' The problem to be solved now is how
    to nurse this babe aright. The thoughtful observer will be easily convinced that the
    careful and proper education of girls is the first step in the solution of this
    problem.</p>
    <p>"The education of girls is of the most vital importance for the uplifting of the
    colored people of the South. Yes, I venture to say that <i>the whole South</i> will
    depend upon their condition for its prosperity. True progress depends upon the
    sacredness and sanctity of the home. That a people or a nation may be happy or
    prosperous it must have enlightened <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
    id="page15"></a>{15}</span> and intelligent homes, and for this purpose the girls
    must be educated in virtue, industry and self-reliance.</p>
    <p>"The colored woman in all conditions and under almost all circumstances is abused
    by all races and classes. There are individuals who love and respect her, but no one
    fears to <i>insult</i> her as they fear to insult other women. Let her turn
    wheresoever she may, she is met by all sorts of evil influences of a character too
    indecorous to think about, and I fear that I should never be forgiven if I should
    name them, yet we are compelled to look upon them everywhere we go. Now a reform must
    begin in the treatment of women, and it must be commenced by paying more attention to
    the education of girls. Only wise mothers can train champions for great causes like
    this. Therefore let our voices and our influence be given to the work of elevating
    the women who have the care of making and preserving society."</p>
    <p>Thus it has come about that a larger and larger proportion of girls come to our
    schools, and it has seemed much better that they should be educated <i>with</i> their
    brothers than <i>apart</i> from them, for a great and grievous lack among the colored
    people, is a pure, safe and wholesome social life for the young people, and with all
    the other labors laid upon these "universe&mdash;ities" is that of fostering such a
    social life and, as far as may be, setting forth the pattern for it. Permit me to
    introduce you to one of these schools which is in many of its features doubtless like
    all the rest.</p>
    <p>Tougaloo University is one of the six chartered institutions maintained by the
    American Missionary Association with some aid from the State in which it is located.
    It is but a few miles from the capital of the great but undeveloped agricultural
    State of Mississippi, a State in which the largest town had, at the last census, less
    than twelve thousand inhabitants. This is very far south, in "the great black belt,"
    where the plantations are large, and upon the country roads you will constantly see
    ten or more colored faces to one white one. It contained at the last census, above
    two hundred thousand more colored people than at Emancipation, and above one hundred
    and seventy thousand more colored than white. Do you not see how rapidly Christian
    education and training must go forward to keep pace with such facts as these?</p>
    <p>Stepping off the afternoon train down the Chicago and New Orleans railway at the
    little station of Tougaloo, we look up through a pleasant vista about three-quarters
    of a mile and see the Mansion, Ballard Hall, Ladies' Hall, and Strieby Hall, the
    latter a brick house three stories high above the basement, dedicated Thanksgiving
    Day of 1881 in the presence of the venerable secretary for whom it was named. The
    work on this building was done by colored mechanics, students of the school making
    the brick and the stone, a sort of concrete for the trimmings.</p>
    <p>Strieby Hall has accommodations for nearly a hundred young men, besides a
    teacher's family or two. It is kept in scrupulous neatness by the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>{16}</span> young men under their
    matron's eye. She teaches them to nurse one another in sickness; she also instructs
    them in the care of their clothing and requires them to mend when the weekly wash
    comes in. One young man became so proud of his skill in this line that he wanted to
    put his darned old socks&mdash;old darned socks would sound better,
    perhaps&mdash;into our industrial exhibit for the New Orleans Exposition, among the
    chains and wheels from the blacksmith and wagon shops, the brackets, step-ladders,
    etc., from the carpenter shop, the cups and coffee-pots from the tinshop, and the
    girls' plain sewing and fancy-work.</p>
    <p>There are regular apprentices to all the trades named, and all the boys of certain
    grades have lessons, one hour daily, in the several shops, to get the use of tools
    and simple work; there is also a course of industrial drawing running through the
    school grades for boys and girls alike.</p>
    <p>The school is upon a plantation of five hundred acres, worked by the young men
    under the direction of the farm superintendent, a graduate of the Massachusetts
    Agricultural College, who gives them "talks," as he terms his lectures, upon
    practical themes pertaining to general farming, fruit-growing, and the care of
    stock.</p>
    <p>As we walk up from the station through, first a wood of water-oak, sweet-gum and
    hickory, then an open glade with scattering persimmon trees upon it, and lastly, a
    fine park of postoaks draped with Spanish moss, we approach the old southern
    "Mansion," which was the only building of any account upon the ground when the
    Association purchased it in 1869, and which is still the handsomest one. It has a
    little romance of its own, having been made spacious and beautiful for a bride who
    never came into it; but, notwithstanding this disappointment of its builder, it has
    in God's providence been greatly connected with home-building.</p>
    <p>Here live the President's family and some of the other teachers. Here are business
    offices, a pleasant reading-room with an open fire upon its hearth, and a small
    library adjoining. In this house is a guest-chamber where all friends of the school
    are made welcome, and here are the music-rooms, one containing a piano and one a
    cabinet organ.</p>
    <p>More and more highly is the department of musical training esteemed by those who
    understand the work. All receive training in vocal music as a part of their daily
    school work, and would there were more with means to take instrumental lessons!</p>
    <p>The best of music is taught, from the primary grades upward; and it is an
    inspiring thing to hear almost everybody who is at work or play, not at books,
    singing and chanting the most beautiful compositions; the girls from attic chamber to
    basement laundry, may be chanting, "Thou who leddest Joseph like a flock," while the
    carpenter's apprentices&mdash;perchance upon a barn-roof&mdash;may be rolling forth
    the temperance Marseillaise, and our ears may distinguish from the neighboring
    "quarters" the little children of the day and Sabbath-school singing cheerily,</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>{17}</span>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>"Angry words, O let them never</p>
        <p class="i2">From the tongue unbridled slip;</p>
        <p>May the heart's best impulse ever</p>
        <p class="i2">Check them ere they pass the lip."</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Nothing, perhaps, more commends the school to the notice of our white neighbors
    than its music, and greater numbers of them will come to a concert than to any other
    exercise.</p>
    <p>In the Mansion are our rooms for the Normal Department, a study room and a
    laboratory. The primary, intermediate and grammar grades are taught in the new
    school-house, between the Mansion and Strieby Hall, the upper part of which is a neat
    and commodious chapel. The primary school is free of tuition as a practice-school for
    the Normal students, and brings in many little ones from the region round about.</p>
    <p>We send forth many teachers for the public schools, and despite the shortness of
    the terms and the want of appliances, we see encouraging evidences of better work
    done there from year to year. Besides test-book teaching, these young
    home-missionaries labor in many lines for the moral, social and material improvement
    of their people, and deserve much help and cheer.</p>
    <p>A Biblical department is preparing young men to preach the gospel, and as they
    have the industrial training too, they will be fitted for a very practical sort of
    evangelism.</p>
    <p>A night-school supplies instruction for farm-laborers, laundry girls, etc.</p>
    <p>All school-room work, except that of the Biblical class and a part of the Normal
    work, is women's work.</p>
    <p>Let us step into the Ladies' Hall on the other side of the Mansion from Ballard
    Hall. This is a very hive of female industry. Here is the girls' dormitory, with a
    capacity of about seventy-five, and the boarding department. All the work of the
    household, with trifling exceptions, is done by the young women and girls of the
    school. Each one does an hour's work a day, having it changed every month, and many
    do more to help themselves along. The girls have the care of their rooms and
    generally take great pride in having perfect "reports" for tidiness. Everything is
    simple and cheap and common, but that does not prevent its being homelike.</p>
    <p>Personal cleanliness is required of course. Some few have been accustomed to it at
    home. One large girl said, when told that she must bathe, that she had not washed all
    over since she could remember, and she still refrained until put "under discipline."
    Finally she yielded, but in the evening was heard crying aloud from a seat on the top
    stair. The matron asked, "What <i>is</i> the matter?" and she replied, "Oh! oh! I've
    wet my skin and it's made me sick." This is a very extreme case of attachment to
    dirt, but it is interesting and marvellous to witness the changes in appearance,
    expression and manners, during a prolonged stay in school.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>{18}</span>
    <p>Besides general housework, the girls are given special instruction in cooking,
    nursing and care of health, under their experienced matron. They sew for an hour a
    day in classes, under the supervision of another lady who also instructs a class in
    cutting by model and dress-making, and sees that all the girls attend properly to
    their mending.</p>
    <p>A Girls' Industrial Cottage has been started on a small scale, in which the girls
    will have the entire charge of household expenses and management. The little girls
    from round about are formed into sewing-bands and make commendable progress. Their
    mothers meet with one of the teachers on Saturday afternoons.</p>
    <p>Underneath all these departments of training, it is sought to lay the great
    foundation principles of character. The Bible is a constantly used text-book in
    literally <i>every</i> department. We seek to give a "Thus saith the Lord," for
    everything that we inculcate, from order, punctuality and cleanliness, up to honesty,
    personal and social virtue, temperance, industry and benevolence.</p>
    <p>There was a time when some distrust was manifest among the colored people for what
    they called "book religion." They wished to hold fast to "ole time 'ligion," and that
    sentiment is not entirely gone. We had a very zealous little neighbor, more aged than
    she looked, so bright and spry was she, whose husband was said to be over a hundred.
    She was a seer of visions and dreamer of dreams. What we thought a bad feature of her
    trances was, that she would sometimes speak in meeting of having seen Tougaloo
    University marching in a procession down to torment with our devoted matron and
    president at the head, their open Bibles in their hands. That was years ago. Now,
    when she sees our matron in her visions, it is up among the angels; and I believe the
    conviction is spreading that book religion, taken into the head, sinking down into
    the heart, and working out through the hands in deeds of active piety, is an
    excellent thing.</p>
    <p>Besides our regular religious services, including our large and delightful
    Sabbath-school, we have various reformative and benevolent societies. Our temperance
    society carries the triple pledge at the front and saves many from the debasement of
    profanity, tobacco and ardent spirits in all their forms.</p>
    <p>Our societies for social purity are designed to help in the cure of a terrible and
    terribly prevalent vice. The young men are taught, that while it would often be
    simply throwing life, with all its opportunities, away, for them to interpose by word
    or weapon in defense of weak and tempted womanhood, after all, man best defends woman
    by himself wearing the "White Cross" of manly virtue.</p>
    <p>The girls are taught that woman's best defense is the "White Shield" of her own
    determined virtue and genuine modesty. The Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A. have interesting
    meetings conducted by themselves, with many committees for Christian work. A
    committee of girls goes out on <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
    id="page19"></a>{19}</span> Saturday to visit sick and aged ones, both giving and
    receiving good. Another looks after new scholars who are often confused by their
    strange surroundings, and homesick for a time.</p>
    <p>Our Missionary Society studies both home and foreign fields, and gives freely of
    its little fund. Recently a flame of missionary zeal was kindled by letters from
    missionaries in Africa with whom a number of our students were personally somewhat
    acquainted, and a large portion of our Sunday-school collections was voted directly
    to them.</p>
    <p>All our students sympathize with the Indians, and there are two societies of the
    younger scholars who help them. The outside sewing-bands too, devoted their very
    first quilt to the Rosebud Indian Mission. "The field is the world" and "the work is
    one, <i>one</i>!"</p>
    <p>Now, I ask you, friends, should not such work as this be amply sustained? So much
    more could be accomplished if the funds and sympathy were not so stinted! "The
    destruction of the poor is their poverty." We do not believe in giving money outright
    to pauperize these young people, but the money <i>must be there</i> or they can not
    be taken into the household, and trained and fitted to do valiant service for Christ,
    and the nation and the world. There are manifold ways of helping, but I shall not
    mention one, for if any are moved to help&mdash;as many are and have been&mdash;it
    will be so easy to find out a way.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Dinah Mulock Craik was prompted to write her last book&mdash;in behalf of
    North of Ireland sufferers&mdash;by hearing a rough carter in a London street, who
    had got down from his cart to help a timid child over a crowded crossing, and had
    been rallied upon his soft-heartedness, say, "O, aye! but a 'andful o' 'elp is wuth a
    cartload o' pity."</p>
    <p>As I have visited institutions rich in buildings, books, scholarships,
    professorships and every appliance, I have been very far from wishing their abundance
    less, but I have said in my heart, ought not this and similar missionary schools to
    be endowed also for their work of broad beneficence, reaching not only the far South
    of our own land, but to the heart of the great dark continent with its two hundred
    millions of perishing souls?</p>

    <h4>THE SANTEE NORMAL TRAINING SCHOOL AND INDIAN MISSIONS.</h4>
    <p class="author">BY MRS. CHAS. W. SHELTON.</p>
    <p>Running Antelope, an Indian chief, describing the condition of the Indians, said:
    "There was once a beautiful, clear lake of water, full of fish. The fish were happy
    and content, had plenty to eat, and nothing to trouble them. One day a man came and
    threw in a lump of mud, which frightened the fishes much and disturbed the water.
    Another day a man came again, and threw in some more mud, and even again and again,
    until <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>{20}</span> the water
    became so thick that the fish could not see at all; they were so blinded and so
    frightened that they ran against one another, and they ran their noses out of the
    water into the mud, where many of them died. In fact, they are in a bad condition,
    indeed. Now, the pond is the Indian country, the fishes are the Indians, the false
    treaties and promises of the white men are the lumps of mud," and, turning to the
    missionaries, he said: "I hope you have come to clear up the water." A glance at the
    work of the A.M.A. among the Indians will show that the missionaries are clearing up
    the water.</p>
    <p>We all have heard of the Santee Normal Training School for Indians, in Nebraska.
    There is much in the name itself, and yet it is impossible to have a clear idea of
    the work done there unless one has seen for himself.</p>
    <p>The Santee School is the largest of all the Indian mission schools under the
    A.M.A., and faithfully has she performed the part of a leader. The number of Indians
    gathered and instructed each year is in the neighborhood of 175. Many tribes are
    represented, and the students come from all directions. They are thoroughly trained
    from the very foundation, not only in the ordinary branches of school work, but also
    in housekeeping&mdash;sewing, cooking, washing, etc.,&mdash;on the part of the girls
    (in which, too, the boys join largely), and in farming, carpentry, blacksmithing and
    shoemaking, on the part of the boys.</p>
    <p>Not only is this solid practical knowledge given them, but care and time is
    devoted toward grace and politeness, and all the foundation rules of etiquette. And
    this is not a thankless work. Anyone forming an idea of Indians from those at Santee
    would tell you they are naturally a most polite people&mdash;a people upon whom grace
    sits easily. There is many a little story of Santee I would like to tell, that would
    show the spirit which pervades the school. Something you may have read of their
    impromptu prayer-meetings, and the desire of many to work and study, not merely for
    themselves, but for their people.</p>
    <p>But great as is the credit due the Indians for their advancement here, little
    could be seen of gain were it not that the corps of teachers sent out by the A.M.A.
    have been chosen, not from the lame, the halt and the blind of this country, not from
    those who for support must resort to something, but from those young women who are
    willing to leave homes of comfort and refinement, in order that their lives may be
    worth something in the world&mdash;young women who are consecrated beyond what we can
    even imagine until we have seen the difficulties and annoyances which form so large a
    part of their lives. Not for <i>support</i> would these women have gone into A.M.A.
    work, but cheerfully and gladly do they live on the very smallest possible salaries,
    that more may be done for the Indian.</p>
    <p>In describing Santee I have described all the schools, for the same <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>{21}</span> plan is carried out
    everywhere&mdash;the plan of Christianization; for that must needs come before
    civilization can be hoped for.</p>
    <p>The Indian is not civilized who, forsaking his heathen gods, has learned the ways
    of the white man without knowing his God; for invariably he learns the vices and the
    crimes; and is in reality more of a heathen than before.</p>
    <p>Many are the villages of Indians in which the white man's <i>dance</i> has been
    introduced and is enjoyed much more than the native dance; it is working much evil
    which is hard to uproot, for they say, "Is it not the white man's way?&mdash;it must
    needs be all right."</p>
    <p>The work among the older people is of course more limited than that done in the
    schools. The age of study is with them past. The most intellectual work of which they
    are capable is learning to read the Bible; even this they cannot do in any other than
    the Dakota language. It is impossible to teach an old man English that will ever mean
    much to him. Our word "holy" could never mean what his own word "wakan" means; our
    word "God" could never take the place of his "Wakantanka." His brain would be so
    disturbed in his effort to learn and to comprehend our difficult language, that when
    he had mastered the words, were it possible, the sweet truth and the comfort would be
    all gone from him. Any but a scholar must read the <i>Bible</i> in his own
    language.</p>
    <p>Thousands of Indians are learning Bible truths and are getting a little light in
    the few years left them. They are learning a little of the way of life, and receive
    the message with gladness. Spotted Bear, a Christian Indian, said at the recent
    convention at Santee: "All we know we have learned out of the Dakota Bible. Teach our
    children English, but don't take from them and us the means of reading our own
    Bible."</p>
    <p>James Garvey, another Indian, said: "Many can soon learn to read the Dakota Bible;
    then they have a standard of morals and of interpretation; for to get the real
    meaning of the English Bible, we go to the Dakota. To make the best citizens you must
    Christianize the people, and to make them Christians you must give them the Bible in
    their own tongue. All of us have become white people through the gospel."</p>
    <p>The little native churches of Dakota are most interesting illustrations of the
    work going on among the Indians. It would be impossible to find more attentive
    audiences. There is always an air of devotion, or of serious attention to all that
    pertains to the service, which we are not apt to find in our own churches. Men, women
    and children go; even the babies are always taken. There is a quiet freedom there
    which allows the Indian mothers to take the babies out and in again at any time, and
    the preacher is never disturbed. They sing as if they enjoyed singing&mdash;men and
    women together; and in fact the services are usually such as to give one a new zeal
    in holy things, even though we can understand few words.</p>
    <p>Each Indian church has its missionary society, and its woman's society, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>{22}</span> which is also
    missionary. These have been working and giving for mission work further out among the
    Indians, and this year have pledged themselves to give to foreign missions. During
    the last year they have raised $1,084, of which the women raised $500. The
    prayer-meeting is as much an institution with them as with us&mdash;in fact, they
    live as we live and work as we work.</p>
    <p>Ehnamani, pastor of the Santee church&mdash;a fine old man, whose history in
    connection with the Minnesota massacre of '62, and whose conversion and present work
    are well known&mdash;was once asked, "Do you ever have the least regret that the old
    life is gone&mdash;do you ever have any longing for the war and for the dance?" His
    face grew stern and hard as he answered, "Regret it! No, indeed! I cannot think of
    one good thing that I ever did in that life, and I cannot bear to remember it." Few
    are there yet like Ehnamani, though many are fast overtaking him, and a grand number
    of Christian workers would you see could they be gathered before you!</p>
    <p>Many are the Indian hearts given back to God their Creator. Many are the Indian
    homes consecrated to the Wakantanka. Many are the Indian lives devoted to His
    service. And yet there are facts&mdash;there are overwhelming facts, sad enough to
    break the great, throbbing Christian heart of this country&mdash;facts that should
    make us cover our heads with shame.</p>
    <p>Out of 40,000 Sioux Indians, there are 35,000 still in heathenism. There are
    sixty-six tribes on the Western prairies for whom nothing is yet done. There are
    40,000 Indians of school age; but when every school is packed to its utmost only
    12,000 can be accommodated. This includes Government schools, Roman Catholic schools,
    and all; so that those under mission teachers would be far less a number than
    12,000.</p>
    <p>And this is where the Indian work stands to-day. How can the A.M.A. do its share
    in this great work, or how can the work already begun be carried on, unless money is
    turned liberally into its treasury?</p>
    <p>Shall the cry for help, coming 1,500 miles across the country, strike against a
    hard wall of indifference and be thrown back to mock the red man and to bid him wait
    yet longer?</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="bureau3" id="bureau3"></a>
    <h4>THE DAKOTA MISSIONARY SOCIETY.</h4>
    <p>Its annual meeting was held in connection with the Dakota Conference, at the
    Santee Agency and in the dining-room of the Normal and Training School. There were
    two hundred Indian sisters present, besides the white lady teachers. They represented
    six mission stations and twice as many churches, each church having a wide awake
    woman's missionary society. After a hymn, the President, Mrs. Tasinasawin, led in
    prayer and read the first three verses of the 21st chapter of Luke, following it with
    a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>{23}</span> few words about
    that widow's mite, saying that it was not the amount given, but the <i>spirit</i> in
    which it was given. That was the important thing. The Indian women are able to give
    but little, but if they give willingly, as to the Lord, He will bless it. The minutes
    were then read, and a new president and secretary elected. Two candidates were put in
    nomination for each office. As the roll was called each woman arose and voted <i>viva
    voce</i>. Mrs. Brascaw was elected president, and Miss Mary C. Collins, secretary. I
    was delighted to see the cheery way in which these sisters-in-red did their voting.
    There were several sallies of laughter.</p>
    <p>Then the delegates made each a report of the work done in their societies and how
    much money had been raised. One woman from the Brown Earth Colony said: "We are poor,
    but we are interested in the work and have done what we could. Mr. Williamson taught
    me to read, and when I was young he taught many others to read. Now I am nearly blind
    but still I have done what I could."</p>
    <p>Another said: When the pastor's wife was well she had helped them very much and
    had taught them many things, but now she was sick and could not attend many of their
    meetings, but they worked on and did the best they could.</p>
    <p>Another said: "The gospel was sent to us when we were in darkness, and now though
    we are few and scattered far apart, yet we are anxious to send the same gospel to
    those who have not yet heard of it, and to help those around us to love our Saviour
    and to love each other, and we give gladly of the little that we have. It is not in
    our own strength that we do this, but it is in God who helps us."</p>
    <p>It was found that the women had raised this year over five hundred dollars. This
    goes into the treasury of the Dakota Society to help to sustain four native
    preachers, who are also teachers, out among the wild Indians. One of the services of
    the Sabbath, the great day of the feast, was to hear from those their own
    missionaries to the heathen. At that meeting I counted five hundred and thirty
    Christian Indians, who also partook of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. To help
    their treasury the women had a Fair for the sale of articles of handiwork. The most
    noted one was a <i>quilt</i> which had been made and sent in by Caroline
    To-tee-doo-ta-win (Scarlet House), of Brown Earth, now in her 97th year. She was one
    of the first three converts who were organized into a church in 1834, at
    Lac-qui-parle, Minn. Her husband had two wives, and she was the second. Finding upon
    conversion that polygamy was contrary to the ordinance of God she at once proposed to
    be put away. She had been a member of the Order of the Sacred Dance, but this she
    renounced, throwing away her "medicine sack," which by the medicine men was regarded
    as a high crime. This subjected her to divers persecutions, which she bore patiently.
    There were times when all were forbidden to attend worship at the mission. Then she
    took joyfully to the spoiling of her goods, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
    id="page24"></a>{24}</span> the cutting up of her blanket, she received the Sabbath
    as God's day, and more than once remained behind her company when they travelled on
    that day, making it up on Monday. She learned from missionaries to spin and knit, and
    weave garments for herself and husband. At forty-five years of age she learned to
    read her Dakota Bible, and of her children she sent one to Ohio to learn the ways of
    Christian white people. She has adhered to the faith for these fifty-four years. With
    her quilt she sent the message that it was the last one she could make. It was bought
    by Miss N. Hunter, a teacher at the Yankton Agency, for four dollars, to be presented
    to Rev. Dr. Arthur Mitchell of the Presbyterian Board. It was this Miss Hunter who
    interpreted for me the addresses of the woman's meeting. Surely the Apostle Paul
    would say of these, "Help those women who labored with me in the Gospel." He who was
    so fond of naming the Christians who were "the first fruits of Achaia," would be very
    loving to this aged disciple, the first fruits of Dakota.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>A missionary from the South writes: "In speaking on prohibition I call attention
    to the fact that wherever there is a missionary school a majority of the colored
    people are Prohibitionists, and in alluding to places where local option has failed
    to banish the saloons because, as is alleged, 'the negroes voted the wet ticket,' I
    add, 'To the white citizens who make this complaint I would say, Oh, that ye had been
    wise! Oh, that during all the years that have elapsed since the war, instead of
    <i>keeping out</i> you had <i>provided</i> Christian teachers for these armed but
    untrained citizens, these dwellers within the gates, with whose fate your own is
    bound! Now would you have had able allies in this conflict with the powers of
    darkness, this struggle between the home and the saloon.'"</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
